Issue: Import and dependency errors while running CinePi and Dashboard

Original errors captured:
- ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package (src modules)
- ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_socketio' (dashboard)
- run.py importing main without package context

Root cause:
- Mixed use of relative and absolute imports in src/ when executing files as scripts rather than as a package.
- Missing/unsynced real-time deps for dashboard environment on the target machine.

Fixes implemented (code changes):
1) Import fallback pattern added to src modules to support both package and script execution.
   - src/capture_utils.py
     - Changed:
       from .config_manager import ConfigManager
     - To:
       try:
           from .config_manager import ConfigManager  # package-relative when run as module
       except (ImportError, SystemError, ValueError):
           from src.config_manager import ConfigManager
   - src/main.py
     - Changed direct imports to fallback pattern:
       try:
           from .config_manager import ConfigManager
       except (ImportError, SystemError, ValueError):
           from src.config_manager import ConfigManager
       try:
           from .metrics import MetricsLogger, ImageQualityMetrics
       except (ImportError, SystemError, ValueError):
           from src.metrics import MetricsLogger, ImageQualityMetrics
       try:
           from .capture_utils import CameraManager
       except (ImportError, SystemError, ValueError):
           from src.capture_utils import CameraManager
       try:
           from .timing_controller import TimingController
       except (ImportError, SystemError, ValueError):
           from src.timing_controller import TimingController

2) run.py now imports safely from package:
   - Changed:
     from main import main
   - To:
     try:
         from src.main import main
     except (ImportError, SystemError, ValueError):
         from .src.main import main  # type: ignore

3) Dependencies:
   - Top-level requirements.txt already includes:
     Flask-SocketIO, python-socketio, eventlet
   - If the target venv/system lacks these, reinstall using commands below.

Validated commands to run:
A) Install dependencies (from project root):
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt

B) Run CinePi main (prefer module execution from project root):
   python -m src.main
   or
   python run.py

C) Run Dashboard (after ensuring deps):
   python run_dashboard.py
   If eventlet is not desired, set Flask-SocketIO async_mode='threading' in dashboard/app.py.

Notes on execution context:
- Always run from the project root so that "src" and "dashboard" packages resolve correctly.
- The fallback import pattern ensures src modules work when run via -m or through run.py.

What remains:
- If dashboard still reports missing flask_socketio, confirm the active environment matches where requirements were installed:
  which python
  python -c "import flask_socketio; print(flask_socketio.__version__)"
- If a different dependency backend is preferred (gevent vs eventlet vs threading), adjust dashboard/app.py SocketIO initialization accordingly.

Resolution status: Updated imports and run wrapper to eliminate “no known parent package” errors and documented dependency setup to resolve Flask-SocketIO errors.
