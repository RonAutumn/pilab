# CinePi Timelapse System Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml and modify as needed

# Camera settings
camera:
  # Image resolution [width, height]
  # Full resolution: [4056, 3040]
  # Half resolution: [2028, 1520]
  # Quarter resolution: [1014, 760]
  resolution: [4056, 3040]
  
  # JPEG quality (1-100, higher = better quality but larger files)
  quality: 95
  
  # ISO sensitivity (100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200)
  # Lower values = less noise but darker images
  iso: 100
  
  # Shutter speed in microseconds (0 = auto)
  # Examples: 0 (auto), 1000000 (1 second), 500000 (0.5 seconds)
  shutter_speed: 0
  
  # Exposure mode
  # Options: auto (automatic exposure), manual (manual exposure with shutter_speed)
  # Note: Only 'auto' is currently fully implemented. Manual modes require shutter_speed > 0
  exposure_mode: "auto"
  
  # Auto white balance mode
  # Options: auto (automatic white balance)
  # Note: Only 'auto' is currently implemented. Manual white balance modes coming soon.
  awb_mode: "auto"

# Timelapse settings
timelapse:
  # Capture interval in seconds
  # Recommended: 30-300 seconds for most timelapses
  interval_seconds: 30
  
  # Total duration in hours (0 = run indefinitely)
  # Examples: 24 (1 day), 168 (1 week), 0 (indefinite)
  duration_hours: 24
  
  # Output directory for captured images
  output_dir: "output/images"
  
  # Filename prefix for captured images
  filename_prefix: "timelapse"
  
  # Image format (jpg, png, bmp)
  # jpg is recommended for best performance
  image_format: "jpg"
  
  # Add timestamp to filename
  add_timestamp: true
  
  # Create daily subdirectories (YYYY-MM-DD)
  create_daily_dirs: true

# Logging settings
logging:
  # Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
  # DEBUG: Detailed information for troubleshooting
  # INFO: General information about system operation
  # WARNING: Only warnings and errors
  # ERROR: Only errors
  log_level: "INFO"
  
  # Directory for log files
  log_dir: "logs"
  
  # CSV filename for metadata logging
  csv_filename: "timelapse_metadata.csv"

# Advanced settings (optional)
# Uncomment and modify as needed

# # Performance optimization for long captures
# camera:
#   resolution: [2028, 1520]  # Lower resolution
#   quality: 85               # Lower quality
#   exposure_mode: "auto"     # Auto exposure
# 
# timelapse:
#   interval_seconds: 60      # Longer intervals

# # High-quality settings for short captures
# camera:
#   resolution: [4056, 3040]  # Full resolution
#   quality: 95               # High quality
#   iso: 100                  # Low ISO
#   exposure_mode: "auto"     # Auto exposure
# 
# timelapse:
#   interval_seconds: 30      # Shorter intervals

# # Night photography settings
# camera:
#   exposure_mode: "night"
#   awb_mode: "tungsten"
#   iso: 400
#   shutter_speed: 2000000  # 2 seconds

# # Daytime outdoor settings
